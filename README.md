Analysis of Sandwich Attacks on Ethereum Blockchain Transactions

This project contains tools for collecting and analyzing sandwich attacks on the Ethereum blockchain.
A sandwich attack is a type of attack that exploits the ordering of transactions in which a malicious agent manipulates a transaction by placing it between two others.

This repository also includes the data that was collected and evaluated during the study.
Transaction data was collected during the period from January to December 2023.

Details of this project were presented in the following article (SBRC 2024): https://sol.sbc.org.br/index.php/sbrc/article/view/29831/29634.

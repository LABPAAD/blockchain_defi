Analysis of Sandwich Attacks on Ethereum Blockchain Transactions

This project contains tools for collecting and analyzing sandwich attacks on the Ethereum blockchain.
This repository also includes the data that was collected and evaluated during the study.
We collect transaction data during the period from January to December 2023.
A sandwich attack is a type of attack that exploits the ordering of transactions in which a malicious agent manipulates a transaction by placing it between two others.
